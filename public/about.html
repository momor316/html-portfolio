<h1>About Me</h1>

<img src="../assets/images/Monique Headshot.jpg" alt="Portrait of designer, Monique" />

<p>I’m a web developer with a foundation in visual arts and interior design, where I spent over a decade creating 
  high-end spaces for clients in Los Angeles and San Francisco. Originally from Southern California, my work and 
  life have always been inspired by diverse cultures and creative perspectives. Studying art and design in Italy 
  for a year and now calling Medellín, Colombia home, I’ve developed a global aesthetic that informs both my design 
  sensibilities and the way I approach digital experiences.

<p>My transition into tech grew from a passion for problem-solving and building user-focused solutions. With a strong 
  background in project management, I’ve led projects from concept to completion, managed cross-functional teams, and 
  optimized workflows for success. Today, I merge strategic thinking, technical skills, and a designer’s eye to create 
  web solutions that balance functionality with visual impact.
